\section*{Appendix A: List of Unit Tests}
\paragraph{} We designed unit tests for the basic helper functions. Here's a list of unit test in test.py file:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item test\_get\_mass: The unit test for testing the helper function to get the total mass of a table. 
    \item test\_tuple\_counts: The unit test for testing the helper function to get the total number of tuples in a table.
    \item test\_tuple\_count\_distinct: The unit test for testing the helper function to get the cardinality of a certain dimension of a table.
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{} We performed unit tests on those function since they are very important building blocks of the whole D-Cube implementation.

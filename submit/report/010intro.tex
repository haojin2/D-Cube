    \item In T3, Hao will be mainly working on the optimizations through database-related techniques such as indexing and query optimization while Yangqingwei will look into possible modifications to the algorithms and metadata caching to further improve the overall performance.
    \item In T4, Yangqingwei will be working on plotting and analysis of data retrieved from application of our implementation on various datasets, and Hao will be working on adding portability support to the code so that the cost is minimum when we want to move to a different dataset with different number of dimensions.
    \item In T5, we will be working together on this task as this will be the heaviest one. Each of us will work on some of the datasets and try out different settings. Finally, we will be working together on any possible further optimizations and work on documentations of our findings.

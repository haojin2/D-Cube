\paragraph{} For this project we aim to implement an anomaly detector for multi-aspect datasets collected from real-life events. As many past studies claim that dense blocks in real-life multi-aspect data indicate anomalies,
our task is alternatively building an efficient detector of dense blocks in real-life datasets. There are many existing dense block detection algorithms for tensors, we chose DCube algorithm as our target algorithm since
it's proven to out-perform many existing algorithms while also ensuring a lower bound on the density of detected blocks. So our goal for this project is to implement, test and evaluate DCube algorithm using SQL on real-life datasets.
The main challenges are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform DCube algorithm, which is not orginally designed for implementation in SQL, to be implemented in SQL.
\item Adopt proper database query optimization techniques to improve the performance of SQL queries to achieve ideal performance on large datasets.
\item Evaluate our implementation on real-life datasets and prove that the implementation is correct.
\item Identify true anomalies from the detected blocks.
\end{enumerate}

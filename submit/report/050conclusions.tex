\paragraph{} Firstly, we successfully completed the implementation of DCube dense block detection algorithm with proper optimizations. Although the overall performance of our implementation
using Postgres is still way slower than the original implementation of DCube, it is still acceptable considering the difference in the speed of hard disks and memory chips. What's more,
we compared the effects of different implementation details on overall performance and provided additional successful optimizations to further improve the performance of our detector.
\paragraph{} Secondly, the outputs of our dense block detector shows that our implementation can correctly detect the top dense blocks in real-life multi-aspect data. The ROC curve of
our results on DARPA and AIRFORCE datasets shows that we have a high true positive rate for detecting network attacks, and the AUC value also illustrates the correctness of our implementaion.
\paragraph{} Thirdly, we successfully extended the usage of our dense block detector to more real-life tensors and successfully detected the top dense blocks in those datasets and also gave our
insights on whether the dense blocks are anomalies or not.
\paragraph{} Furthermore, although we've proved that our implementation has good speed and correct results, there's always room for improvement, we think that this project can still be
improved in the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a different DBMS for even faster execution.
\item Create even more indices to improve as much of the computation as possible.
\item Application to more real-life data to check for correctness and performance.
\end{enumerate}
